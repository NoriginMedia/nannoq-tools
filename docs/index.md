## Modules

[Auth](https://noriginmedia.github.io/nannoq-tools/auth)

```
auth is a collection of classes for managing JWT based authentication and authorization on a vertx environment.

It supports:
 - JWT Creation
 - JWT Verification
 - JWT Revocation
 - OAuth Login
 - Direct Token Conversion
 
Current providers:
 
 - Facebook
 - Google
 - Instagram
```

[Cluster](https://noriginmedia.github.io/nannoq-tools/cluster)

```
cluster is a collection of classes for managing services and API's in clustered Vert.x environments as well as helpers for clustering.

Main features:
 - ServiceManager (Manage services and API's easily across a vertx cluster)
 - ApiManager (Creates Http Records for the ServiceManager)

```

[Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://noriginmedia.github.io/nannoq-tools/fcm)

```
fcm is a XMPP server implementation for use with Firebase Cloud Messaging with all features, for a Vert.x environment.

It supports:
 - Topics
 - Direct Messages (Down and Upstream)
 - Device Groups
 - Device Registrations
```

[Repository](https://noriginmedia.github.io/nannoq-tools/repository)

```
repository is a collection of repository implementations for Vert.x. All repositories operate with a unified querying interface that abstracts away the underlying data store. Individual implementations will be extended for any data store specific functionality that is not reasonable to abstract away.

It supports:
 - Caching, extends to clustered caching with JCache if vertx is clustered.
 - Will refresh ETags if supplied an EtagManager implementation.
 
Operations:
 - Batch create/read/update/delete
 - Queries
   * Filtering
   * Ordering
   * Projections
   * Aggregations
```

[Web](https://noriginmedia.github.io/nannoq-tools/web)

```
web is a REST (Level 3) controller implementation that is based on vertx-web and leverages [nannoq-repository](https://github.com/NoriginMedia/nannoq-repository) for data store access.

It incorporates:
 - ETag
 - Clustered Caching through nannoq-repository

It supports:
 - Filtering
 - Ordering
 - Projections
 - Grouping
 - Aggregations
 - Cross-Model Aggregations
```
